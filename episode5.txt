two types of exports

one is 

export default component name

other is 

export const variable=; //Named export 

React Hooks are normal JavaScript utility functions -it gives utility.

-useState()- super powerful state variable in react --whenever state variable updates react will re renders  the components
-useEffect()

react uses reconciliation algorithm which is also known as react fiber

React is doing efficient dom manipulation because it is having virtual dom then it can find difference between two virtual dom and update ui using diff algorithm.

there are two approaches to fetch the data;
1.as soons as page loads we can make api call when we get data then we render UI;
2.as soons as page loads we will render UI now we will make api as soon as we get data from api we will re render the page ;
In react we will use second approach;

whenever state variable update,react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders component).
