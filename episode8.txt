   -parent render 
   -first child constructor
   -first child render

   -first child component did mount 
   -second child component did mount

Component did mount is called to make Api calls.Why?
react first batches the render phases of all then commit phase happen which is component did mount as it is dom updation which is expensive 
first contructor called and then render is called where basic render will happend on dom then component did mount  will be called so that it will be  easy for update the data from api call on dom. 

Mounting Life Cycle ;

render(dummy data);
<HTML DUMMY DATA >

<API CALL>
<this .set state>

Update
then render with api data.<HTML WITH API DATA> then it will component did Update
